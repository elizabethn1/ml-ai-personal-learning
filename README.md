# Machine Learning and AI Practice
This repository contains my personal machine learning and AI practice notebooks.
Each topic is organized in its own folder, with Jupyter notebooks and related datasets included.

Note: This is a work in progress. More topics will be added as I progress in my learning journey.

## Topics Covered (continuously updated)
- Data preprocessing
- Regression (coming soon!)
- Classification (coming soon!)
- Clustering (coming soon!)
- Association Rule Learning (coming soon!)
- Reinforcement Learning (coming soon!)
- Natural Language Processing (coming soon!)
- and more...

## How to View Notebooks 
GitHub sometimes doesn't render '.ipynb' files properly and shows a message like "Unable to render a block."

### Use nbviewer as a workaround:
Open [https://nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org)  
Paste the GitHub notebook URL to view it correctly.

> Example:  
> [View data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb in nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/elizabethn1/ml-ai-personal-learning/blob/main/data_preprocessing_in_python/data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the specific folder you want to explore.
2. Make sure the download **both** the '.ipynb' notebook and any related '.csv' or related files in the same folder.
3. Open the '.ipynb' files in Jupyter, VSCode, or Google Colab.
4. Run the code cells. Make sure the data file (e.g. 'Data.csv') is in the **same directory** as the notebook to avoid file path errors.
